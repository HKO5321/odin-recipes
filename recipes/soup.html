    <h1> SOUP </h1>
    <img src="../images/image.webp">

    <h2> Description</h2>
    <p> To make a hearty and comforting chicken soup, 
        gather the following ingredients: bone-in, skin-on chicken pieces (such as thighs
         or drumsticks), carrots, celery, onions, garlic, fresh thyme, bay leaves, salt, pepper, 
         and chicken broth. Start by seasoning the chicken pieces with salt and pepper. In a large 
         pot, heat some olive oil over medium heat and brown the chicken on all sides to enhance 
         flavor. Remove the chicken and sauté chopped onions, garlic, carrots, and celery until 
         they become tender. Return the chicken to the pot, add fresh thyme and bay leaves, and 
         pour in enough chicken broth to cover the ingredients. Bring the soup to a simmer, reduce 
         the heat, and let it cook until the chicken is cooked through and the vegetables are tender.</p>
    <p> Once the chicken and vegetables are cooked to perfection, remove the chicken from the pot 
        and shred the meat using two forks. Discard the bones and skin. Return the shredded chicken 
        to the soup, and adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper to taste. If desired, you can add 
        cooked noodles or rice for a heartier soup. Let the soup simmer for a few more minutes to 
        allow the flavors to meld together. Before serving, remove the bay leaves and thyme stems. 
        Ladle the warm and comforting chicken soup into bowls, garnish with fresh parsley, and serve 
        with a slice of crusty bread for a wholesome and delicious meal that's perfect for any 
        occasion.
