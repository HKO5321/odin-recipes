    <h2> Description</h2>
    <p>To craft a classic and indulgent macaroni and cheese, begin by boiling a pot of water and 
        cooking elbow macaroni until it reaches a tender yet slightly firm texture. In a separate 
        saucepan, melt butter over medium heat and stir in an equal amount of all-purpose flour to
        create a roux. Gradually whisk in warm milk, ensuring a smooth consistency. As the mixture 
        thickens, add generous amounts of shredded sharp cheddar cheese, stirring until the cheese 
        fully melts into the velvety sauce. Season with a pinch of salt and a dash of mustard for
         an extra depth of flavor. Combine the luscious cheese sauce with the cooked macaroni,
          coating each piece evenly in the rich mixture.
    </p>
    <p> For the finishing touch, transfer the creamy macaroni and cheese into a baking dish. 
        Top it with additional shredded cheese and, if desired, breadcrumbs for a delightful 
        crunch. Bake the dish in a preheated oven until the top becomes golden brown and bubbly. 
        The aroma of bubbling cheese and the anticipation of that golden crust will heighten your
         senses. Once out of the oven, let it cool for a few minutes before serving, allowing the 
         flavors to meld together. Spoon out a portion of this comforting and cheesy delight onto 
         your plate, savoring each forkful of the creamy macaroni and cheese, a timeless and 
         irresistible dish for all ages.
    </p>
